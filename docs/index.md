# CRDDM

DRDDM is a Python package for modeling continuous-report decision tasks using **Continuous Response Diffusion Decision Models (CRDDM)**. 

The package provides fast and numerically stable likelihood evaluation for continuous-response diffusion decision models using the integral equation method proposed by [Hadian Rasanan et al.,(2025)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02810-3). CRDDM supports a wide range of continuous response scale, that can be employed in experimental studies including:
- Bounded one-dimensional scales (e.g., arcs or sliders),
- Circular scales (e.g., color wheels),
- Two-dimensional scales (e.g., 2D planes).

CRDDM is designed for researchers in cognitive science, mathematical psychology, and neuroscience who work with diffusion models of continuous responses.
